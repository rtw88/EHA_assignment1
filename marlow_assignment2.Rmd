This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

setwd("~/Google\ Drive/event_history_analysis/EHA_assignment2/Inputs")

#read in data
library(readr)
table22 <- read_csv("exercise_table2_2.csv")

colClasses=c("ageinterval"="character"))

library(dplyr)
glimpse(table22)


View(table22)
#add a comment
install.packages("LifeTables")
names(table22)
df <- table22 %>% mutate(S = numalivebint/100000,
                         F = numdeadint/(5*100000),
                         H = (numdeadint/5)/(numalivebint-(5*numdeadint)))

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
summary(table22)
names(table22)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
table22 <- table22 %>% 
  mutate( 
    
  )
```


2c . Median survival time at age 0 

tj = 70  ti = 0 
b = 5 (width of interval)
stj = .60 

tj + 1 = 75 

74.2 is the answer 

2d. = .94005

2f. at age 1, 2.59% of the population has failed
