This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
setwd("./Inputs")

#read in data
table22 <- read.csv("exercise_table2_2.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE, sep=",", colClasses=c("ageinterval"="character"))

library(dplyr)
glimpse(table22)

#add a comment
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
summary(table22)
names(table22)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
